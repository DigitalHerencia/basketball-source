## Project Overview

I've created a Basketball-Reference.com clone called "Basketball Stats Hub" personalized for Silas Roman, a 16-year-old basketball fan from Anthony, NM who attends Gadsden High School and plays trombone in the band. The site features Gadsden High School's maroon color scheme and black panther mascot.
